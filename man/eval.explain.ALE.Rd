\title{Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) for SPQR / SPQRX Models}
\usage{
eval.explain.ALE(model, x, tau = 0.5, k = NULL, knots = NULL, var.index = c(1))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object returned by \code{fit_spqrx()}.}

\item{x}{Matrix or data frame of covariates used to compute ALE.}

\item{tau}{Numeric vector of quantile levels in (0,1).}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of intervals used to partition the selected
feature. If \code{NULL}, it is determined from the spline structure.}

\item{knots}{Numeric vector of spline knots. If \code{NULL},
extracted from the fitted model.}

\item{var.index}{Integer vector specifying the column index of the
covariate for which ALE is computed.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{x}: The interval boundary points used for the feature.
  \item \code{ALE}: Matrix of accumulated local effects. Rows correspond
  to feature intervals and columns correspond to quantile levels.
}
}
\description{
Computes first-order Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) for a selected
covariate using a fitted SPQR or SPQRX model. The ALE function measures
the average change in the predicted quantile as the feature varies
across empirical intervals.
