\title{Plot Predicted Probability Density Function (PDF) for a Single Observation}
\usage{
eval.plot.pdf(model, x0, npdf_points = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted SPQRX model object returned by \code{fit_spqrx()}.}

\item{x0}{A numeric vector representing the covariate values for the observation to plot.}

\item{npdf_points}{Integer. Number of points to evaluate the PDF along the y-axis. Default is 500.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Produces a ggplot2 plot of the predicted PDF for the observation.
}
\description{
Generates a plot of the predicted probability density function (PDF) for a single observation
using a fitted SPQRX model. The x-axis is the response variable \code{y}, and the y-axis
represents the predicted density. The plot is restricted to the range between the 1st and 99th
predicted quantiles for better visualization.
}
\details{
The function computes the predicted PDF over a grid of y-values from the model's
normalized output range. It scales the y-axis based on the model's predicted
1st and 99th quantiles to focus on the main density mass.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plot PDF for the 102nd observation in the dataset
eval.plot.pdf(model = fitted_model, x0 = x_training[102, ])
}
