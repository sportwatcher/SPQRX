\usage{
preprocessing.data(
  x,
  y,
  n.knots,
  testing_ratio = 0.1,
  valid_ratio = 0.1,
  normalize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix of covariates.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector or matrix of response values.}

\item{n.knots}{Integer. Number of spline knots.}

\item{testing_ratio}{Proportion of data allocated to testing.}

\item{valid_ratio}{Proportion of training data allocated to validation.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If TRUE, standardizes predictors and rescales response.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item Training, validation, and testing splits
  \item Spline knot locations
  \item Normalization metadata (if applicable)
}
}
\description{
Splits data into training, validation, and testing sets and
optionally applies normalization to predictors and response.
}
\details{
When normalization is enabled, predictors are standardized
using training-set statistics, and the response is rescaled
to the unit interval.
